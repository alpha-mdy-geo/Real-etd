Project Details

Project Title  Electronic Thesis and Dissertation System

Project ID     Geo-Mandalar Investment & Technology Internship


**Chapter 1**
**Introduction**

**1.1	Introduction**
                Nowadays, Mobile phones are very useful for everyone to communicate with each other. So, they are becoming an important part of our everyday life. Nowadays, reducing the men’s physical effort with the help of latest devices and technologies is on demand. The project provides us the complete and accurate information about thesis.
                The project named “Electronic Thesis and Dissertations System” is aimed to search easily thesis data. The project is developed for window side and mobile phones. Our project mainly focuses on basic operations like inserting new data, updating or deleting existing data, view thesis data and so on. This project has many advantages that to reduce users wait times, accessible from anywhere at any time and do not need storage space in libraries.
                  This project has the lists of titles, authors, year and degree on the website to find collections of thesis. Each collection has a short description to help users decide which one to use.
                   Our project is very useful for users who want to save their times, who can search easily data that users want to know and manual actions of the thesis for both users and admin.



**1.2	Background of the System**
**1.2.1 Evaluation of the literature relevant to the project area**

         We have to consider about the method, approach, programming language and tools in developing the project. Methodology will be used as I structure the project plan; it will represent how the project will be processed. Thus we structure the project’s framework, we need to consider about the project development. In the project area, we can use HTML, Materializecss, Material Design Lite, JavaScript, Real-Time database of firebase and SAD. We must use UML technique to propose the business processes in the project area; we can define the process notations by using UML diagrams. In order to code the program, we can use many computer languages.

**1.2.2 HTML**
     HTML is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create.
              The definition of HTML is **HyperText Markup Language.                                              **

    HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.
    Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).
    HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.



1.2.3	 Materializecss
                Materialize CSS is a UI component library which is created with CSS, JavaScript and HTML. It is created and designed by Google. Materialize CSS is also known as Material Design. It is a design language which combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology. Google's goal is to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform. It is used to construct attractive, consistent, and functional web pages and web apps while adhering to modern web design principles such as browser portability, device independence, and graceful degradation.
Important Features of Materialize CSS
<ul>
<li>	It is a standard CSS with minimal footprint.</li>
<li>	In-built Responsive Design</li>
<li>	It is free to use and requires jQuery JavaScript library to function properly.</li>
<li>	It is cross-browser, compatible, and can be used to create reusable web components.</li>
<li>	It contains enhanced and specialized features such as cards, tabs, navigation bars, toasts etc.</li>
<li>	It provides new versions of common user interface     controls such as buttons, checkboxes, and text fields adapted to follow Material Design concepts.</li>
</ul>

1.2.4	 Material Design Lite (MDL)<br>

                MDL makes it easy to add a material design look and feel to your websites. The “Lite” part of MDL comes from several key design goals: MDL has few dependencies, making it easy to install and use. It is framework-agnostic, meaning MDL can be used with any of the rapidly changing landscape of front-end tool chains. MDL has a low overhead in terms of code size, and a narrow focus — enabling material design styling for websites.
               MDL is a complementary implementation to the Paper elements built with Polymer. The Paper elements are fully encapsulated components that can be used individually or composed together to create a material design-style site, and support more advanced user interaction. That said, MDL can be used alongside the Polymer element counterparts.

1.2.5	 JavaScript (JS)<br>
                    JavaScript is a programming language
commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. For example, a JavaScript function may check a web form before it is submitted to sure all the required fields have been filled out.
 The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any information is actually transmitted to the server.
Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP,      
JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. 
However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.

1.2.6	 System Analysis and Development (SAD)<br>

                 To evaluate and design databases; to develop and program systems using web technologies; to carry out technical feasibility studies using criteria based on cost and efficiency to select alternatives; to administer and develop data processing projects; to administer, dimension and maintain computer networks; to work as software engineers; and to work in teaching and research.


1.2.7	 UML<br>
          Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used as to illustrate the object oriented systems and presentations. UML is a general architectural structure. It is derived from three notations; OMT (Object Modeling Technique). OOD (Object Oriented Design) and OOSE (Object Oriented Software Engineering). UML has a set of connectors and signs to use for drawing the diagrams. These diagrams can represent the business processes and functions from the companies or organizations by using UML. So, we can model the computer code and program by using these diagrams. We can know about the business processes ideas by using UML diagrams in the project.
             In this project, we use Use Case Diagram to describe a set of actions that can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system. We use sequence diagram to show object interactions arranged in time sequence.

1.2.8 What is Database?<br>
          A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.
          Data is organized into rows, columns and tables, and it is indexed to make it easier to find relevant information. Data gets updated, expanded and deleted as new information is added. Databases process workloads to create and update themselves, querying the data they contain and running application against it.
          Computer database typically contain aggregations of data records or files, such as attendance transactions, attendance percentage and reports.
           Typically, a database manager provides users with the ability to control read/write access, specify report generation and analyze usage. Some databases offer ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) compliance to guarantee that data is consistent and that transactions are complete.


Real-Time Database<br>
            A real-time database (RTDB) is a data store whose operations execute with predictable response, and with application-acceptable levels of logical and temporal consistency of data, in addition to timely execution of transactions with the ACID properties. A real-time database is a database system which uses real-time processing to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing. This differs from traditional databases containing persistent data, mostly unaffected by time. For example, a stock market changes very rapidly and is dynamic.

CHAPTER 2<br>
METHDOLOGY

2.1 Requirement Analysis<br>
         The description of the services and constraints are the requirements for the system. Requirement Analysis is the process of deriving the system requirements through observation of existing system. We get all information of data we use in this project from our library.
 <br>     
Group Interview<br>
               Interview is the most common technique for collecting required information. Group interview is same as the one-to-one interview but more than one person at the same role can be involved in Group Interview. We go to libraries and meet all staff to make group interview. We discuss with them; what they need and how they are operating the trading process with clients in manual system. We ask them open-ended question to get requirements and then ask probing question for uncovering requirements.

Questionnaire<br>
                 Questionnaire is one the information gathering techniques and it is informal technique. We use this technique to gather required information about staff from Library. We have some questions to ask about thesis and we have not enough time to interview with each staff to collect requirements, so we use questionnaire tool.

Follow People Around<br>
             We cannot understand about make assign to staff at the Library. So we need to watch how they can be assigned schedule for repair thesis books. Someday, we also participate in the actual work process to get complete understanding about the staff assign at the library.

Evidence of Requirements Analysis<br>
                In analysis requirements from Library, we made use information gathering tools to collect required data. These gathering tools are Group Interview, Questionnaire and Follow People Around. I will represent evidences during analyzing requirements data for developing project.

Evidence form Group Interview<br>
               We make group interview with staff from Library. We discuss about normal thesis in manual system. In the interview, we ask them what they need for the new computerized system and take a note to make requirement lists of different perspectives from each staff. The following sheet will represent requirement list.

Evidence form Questionnaire<br>
                  We ask staff from Library, how thesis books are assigned in the manual system. We ask them the staff’s assign process with a few questions and write down the paper. We also request staff data entry form as a requirement of staff registration. This helps us to develop the system design easily. The following papers will show how staff can be assigned.
 
2.2 Software Selection<br>
Chosen Programming Language<br>
     We would like to use HTML, Materializecss, Material Design Lite and JavaScript in our project because there are a lot of benefits. Material Design is a design language developed by Google. 
<ul>
<li>    They can simply code and it can be very easy to develop and can be reformed very quickly.</li>
<li>	They are particularly available and have multiple extensions.</li>
<li>	They are very popular so we can find many references and guidelines from the internet.</li>
<li>	They are readily available and easy to access.</li>
</ul>
